### Hey, hope you're having a good day :)

## Working on
Not really anything at this point in time. Sort of just having fun
and doing whatever I want.

## Learning
Rust. Loving this language so far, don't know what I might make but
I know for a fact I'm gonna use it as much as I can.

## Extra
Just ask, my discord is `michael.#8869`
